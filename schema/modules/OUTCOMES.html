            <h2>Outcome Details</h2>
            <p>The Outcome Details Brightspace Data Set provides details of the outcomes that are part of all registries in all your org units. User IDs and dates are only populated for authored outcomes because updates to ASN outcomes rely on the cache invalidation system (performed by a system user). The only available data for authored outcomes is from June 2021 onwards. All data for ASN imported outcomes is available, starting with your organization&#039;s first use of Learning Outcomes.</p>
