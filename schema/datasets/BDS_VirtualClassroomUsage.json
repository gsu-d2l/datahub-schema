    "description": "The Virtual Classroom Usage Brightspace Data Set returns information about how Virtual Classroom by Bongo is being used for Bongo Premium customers. The first data point is from July 1, 2018 and the data set will only appear for Bongo Premium customers if there is usage to retrieve. Note: The data includes all Virtual Classroom meetings that have ever been created. Cancelled meetings can be identified using the IsCancelled field, and do not appear in the LTI Links Brightspace Data Set. The Virtual Classroom UI only displays meetings that are scheduled to occur in the future, or have occurred and were recorded. Note: This data set is available as a FULL CSV containing all of the data and does not include a differential. Data is produced on a weekly basis, regardless of whether you purchased the hourly data freshness add-on. Since the data is owned by Bongo, data set generation is done on a region schedule and may not align to existing schedules.   Returned Fields",
